I am pursuing my PhD in Computer Science and Engineering at <a href="https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a> under the supervision of Dr. Valeria Bertacco. My research focuses on computer hardware and exploring memory systems. I earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from the American University of Sharjah (AUS) where I published research in the areas of security and machine learning. As for teaching experience, I worked as a teaching assistant for several courses including both hardware and software. I awarded the best teaching assistant in the computer science and engineering department as well as the best leadership award at AUS.
